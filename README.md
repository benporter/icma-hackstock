Submission for the 2014 ICMA Hackstock competition

Neli and I came in first place, using R, Shiny and ESRI maps.

Competition: <a href="http://icma.org/en/icma/events/conference/events/hackathon">ICMA Hackstock</a>

From the organizer, ICMA:
"Participants in Hackstock will use data provided by local governments across North America to develop new mobile and online apps and dashboards needed for greater citizen engagement and improved service delivery."

<b>Overview<b>

R and Shiny, with ESRI maps rendered through iframes

Sample shot that demonstrates two different neighborhoods.  The ESRI maps on top highlight points of interest and are interactive.  Below are driving times to those two neighborhoods.  Driving time is on the y-axis and time of day is the x-axis.  The two vertical lines are markers for 9:00 and 5:00 pm, to highlight the impact of rush hour on driving times.
